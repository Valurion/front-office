            The offers and prices are valid the day the website is consulted; they can be changed without notice.<br>
            In the case of an order from a country outside of the European Union, the buyer is the importer of the concerned product(s). For all products sent outside of the European Union and the French Overseas Departments and Territories, the price will be automatically calculated on the invoice excluding tax.<br>
            Customs duties, other local taxes or import duties or government taxes may be due. These duties and amounts are not the responsibility of CAIRN SA. They are paid by the buyer and it is the buyer’s responsibility to declare and make payments to authorities and/or the competent institutions of the buyer’s country. CAIRN SA recommends consulting the competent local authorities for information on these issues.<br>
            The prices offered at the end of the order process indicate the total price and include delivery fees and, if applicable, the VAT.<br>
            Prices are listed in euros.

        <h3 class="general-section-title-small">5 – Availability</h3>
        <p class="general-p">
            The product offerings and prices of CAIRN SA are valid as long as they are visible on the websites, subject to availability.<br>
            In the case of unavailability of an article, the buyer is informed as soon as possible by email or mail.<br> 
            The buyer who is informed that a product is unavailable may cancel the order by contacting customer service.<br>
            In any event, CAIRN SA cannot be held liable for damages resulting from the unavailability of an article.

        <h3 class="general-section-title-small">7 – Delivery Timeframe</h3>
        <p class="general-p">
            CAIRN SA will ensure that the order is processed as soon as possible. CAIRN SA cannot, however, be held liable for any delays in order processing or delivery.<br>
            Should an order not be honored within thirty days of confirmation, the buyer may cancel it, at no cost, as long as the buyer notifies CAIRN SA of such cancelation by email, fax, or registered mail.<br>
            Amounts that the buyer has already paid will then be reimbursed within thirty days of the date of the request for reimbursement. Should articles be delivered on different dates based on their availability, the delivery will be based on the longest timeframe. Nevertheless, CAIRN SA reserves the right to split shipments.<br>
            Indicated delivery timeframes are average timeframes and correspond to processing and delivery times for products delivered within Belgium.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="general-section-title-small">8 – VAT</h3>
        <p class="general-p">
            Prices indicated on the website include the Belgian VAT. This is due for all consumers not subject to the VAT who reside in or have their headquarters in a European Union country. It is also due for consumers subject to the VAT who are headquartered in Belgium. Consumers subject to the VAT who are headquartered in another country in the European Union and who wish to have a delivery sent to that country, as well as consumers from countries outside of the European Union have the option to be billed without tax. To do this, they must communicate their request to CAIRN SA by email, fax, or registered mail. It is their responsibility to declare the import in compliance with the fiscal regulations of their country of residence.<br>
            In any event, consumers subject to the VAT are required to declare their VAT number on the order form. CAIRN SA reserves the right to suspend an order if this information is not communicated or if the transmitted number proves to be incomplete or wrong.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="general-section-title-small">9 – Shipping Fees</h3>
        <p class="general-p">
            Shipping fees that the buyer may possibly incur are communicated, online, at the time of order.<br>
            Delivery fees are borne by the buyer and are added to the price of the ordered product(s) and included in the invoice.<br>
            If CAIRN SA splits the order for reasons of availability, the processing and delivery fees will be charged for a single delivery.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="general-section-title-small">10 – Damages and Losses</h3>
        <p class="general-p">
            Pursuant to the Belgian law of July 14, 1991 on trade practices and consumer protection, the burden of damages or losses rests with the remote seller. Thus, if the received product does not correspond to the item the buyer ordered or if it is damaged, it is possible for the buyer to return it to CAIRN SA within seven days of receipt. CAIRN SA will exchange the product or reimburse the amount of the order, as well as shipping fees, within thirty days of receiving the returned item. However, CAIRN SA reserves the right to refuse to reimburse returned products if they are damaged by the buyer.<br>
            In general, an order will be deemed delivered within five business days of receipt of the items by the carrier responsible for delivery. If, however, one or more ordered products do not reach the buyer at the provided delivery address within thirty days of order confirmation, it is the buyer’s responsibility to contact CAIRN SA, within a reasonable timeframe, to verify the status of the order. In the event that the product that should have been delivered was misplaced during the delivery process, CAIRN SA will make a new shipment or reimburse the amount of the order (including shipping costs of the first order).
