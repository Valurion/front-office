                    To make this invaluable content accessible to a <span style="white-space:nowrap;">non–francophone</span> readership, Cairn.info launched Cairn International Edition, an English-language platform where abstracts and selected articles from key journals on Cairn.info are translated from French into English, enabling users to search, browse and read this content without speaking a word of French.

                    Cairn International Edition received support from the Centre National du Livre, a French governmental agency dedicated to the promotion of French publications around the world.

            <h2 class="general-section-title"><a id="cadenza"></a>About Cadenza Academic Translations</h2>
            <p class="general-p justify">
                At <a class="inline-link" href="http://www.cadenza-academictranslations.com"><strong>Cadenza Academic Translations</strong></a> we specialize in academic articles, papers and books in the arts, humanities and social sciences, working with universities, research organizations, academic journals and publishing houses.<br />
                Cadenza embraces a dual ethos: fidelity to the author’s words and close attention to how an author’s vision of the world may be conveyed, intact and with élan, to the target readership.<br />
                We apply these principles with absolute equality, whether we are working on a text of three hundred words or a three-million words project. From Aristotle to Zeno, from anthropology to Zoroastrianism, the Cadenza team delights in the linguistic journeys that carry enlightenment back and forth across the world.<br />
                To make this work, to make it more than an aspiration, we count on the diverse academic background of our translators to match subject with expertise. Familiarity with the relevant publications, minute attention to detail, scrupulous checking of referencing, and concern for appropriate style are the hallmarks of all our work.<br />
                Cadenza’s translators and editors are all highly qualified in their respective fields, but that is not enough: through our rigorous testing procedure they also have to demonstrate the ability to reproduce complex ideas that are perfectly at ease in their new linguistic vehicle.
